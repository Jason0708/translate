This category is for tagging common types of application security attacks. 

==What is an attack?==

Attacks are the techniques that attackers use to exploit the vulnerabilities in applications. Attacks are often confused with vulnerabilities, so please try to be sure that the attack you are describing is something that an attacker would do, rather than a weakness in an application.

All attack articles should follow the [[Attack template]].

==Examples:==

*Brute Force: Is an exhaustive attack that works by testing every possible value of a parameter (password, file name, etc.) [[:Brute_force_attack|Brute_force_attack]]
*Cache Poisoning: Is an attack that seeks to introduce false or malicious data into a web cache, normally via HTTP Response Splitting.  [[:Cache_Poisoning|Cache_Poisoning]]
*DNS Poisoning: Is an attack that seeks to introduce false DNS address information into the cache of a DNS server, where it will be served to other users enabling a variety of attacks. (e.g., Phishing)

Note: many of the items marked vulnerabilities and other places are really attacks. Some of the more obvious are:
* [[Resource exhaustion]]
* [[Reflection injection]]
* [[Reflection attack in an auth protocol]]

► Path Traversal Attack‎ (1 P)
    Category:Path Traversal Attack
    Description
    This category of attacks exploit various path vulnerabilities to access files or directories that are not intended to be accessed. This attack works on applications that take user input and use it in a "path" that is used to access a filesystem. If the attacker includes special characters that modify the meaning of the path, the application will misbehave and may allow the attacker to access unauthorized resources. This type of attack has been successful on web servers, application servers, and custom code.
    
    Examples
    The most basic Path Traversal attack uses the '../' special character sequence to alter the location of the request. In an Operating System, this special character combination notes to move down one directory. An example of such an attack could look like the following: http://foo.com/../../barfile
    
    While the web server may stand up well to such an attack, another approach is to target the application itself. Most commonly the use of parameters being passed by the application can be exploited. Such data can come from user input or application data being passed between pages. Let's take for the following example into account: http://foo.com/bar.cgi?store=mystore.html
    
    We can observe from the above that bar.cgi takes a parameter to navigate through the application; in this case, the store location is mystore.html. We can use this knowledge to attempt the retrieval of bar.cgi's source code by submitting: http://foo.com/bar.cgi?store=bar.cgi
    
    This can be taken a step further. By combining the two methods above one may be able to retrieve server resident content using the application as a means of accessing it. Keep in mind, the web server daemon (process) runs as a user on the machine and as such the application has read access to certain areas. Using the foobar store example URL above, let's look at how we can grab a file from another location of the server: http://foo.com/bar.cgi?store=../../secretfile.txt
